## Hi there 👋 I'm Bao

### About me
I am an PhD candidate in the Complex Networks and Systems track at Indiana University. Check out [my website](https://btrantruong.github.io/) for the latest information about what I am doing.

- 🔭 I work on social media moderation. This includes developing methods to detect abuse and bad actors, modeling the impacts of deterrence strategies, and designing *prosocial* recommendation algorithms.
- 💬 Talk to me about social media-tech policies, ranking algorithms, online community norms, graph embeddings, agent-based models (llm-powered or not), or how to make a rich, moist, vibrant lemon bundt cake 🍋
